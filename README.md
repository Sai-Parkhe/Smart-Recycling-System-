# ♻️ Smart Waste Classification System

An AI-powered waste classification system that uses deep learning to identify and categorize waste from images. The project aims to improve recycling efficiency and enhance safety for waste-handling workers through automated image-based classification.

## 📌 Overview

Manual waste segregation is time-consuming, unsafe, and highly dependent on human expertise. This project leverages a trained **MobileNetV2-based deep learning model** to classify waste images and provide instant predictions through a simple and interactive web interface.

Users can either upload an image from their device or capture an image using a camera, making the system practical and user-friendly.
